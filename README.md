# Quantitative-Economic-Modelling-with-Data-Science-Applications

The main goal of our project was to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict housing prices based on the features existing in our data, and compare between them. We believe that if successful, our findings can benefit anyone who's trying to estimate housing prices both as a buyer and a seller. In the project we built a system that predicts the price of a certain house, under certain conditions. The project deals with a Regression problem, where each observation ends with a predicted house price. We have got Several features, which we tried to reach conclusions about the meaning and interpretation of each one of them.

In the project we used a lot of the material taught in the course and based on it We made many assumptions that helped us in its realization. As mentioned, for optimal prediction, we performed the same process on the test data and used the pre-processing of the training data in order to process them. It is important for us to mention the circularity of the process. We performed several iterations of each step, where in each iteration we relied on the results of the previous iterations, and made considerations such as which values should be removed or how to normalize the data to ultimately give the best predictions from our models.
